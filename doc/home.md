# project requirement

## First Ideas
    - need a login to authenticate the user (no subscription)
    - manage services from my vps
    - notify when something went wrong
    - back-end to communicate In Real Time the statu of each services
    - can be either a service or just a metric (ram, cpu, network, memory usage, etc)
    - possibility to restart/stop/start a service
    - communication using https/wss protocol
